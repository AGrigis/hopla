Basic example on how to use the SLURM cluster
=============================================

Basic example

When you're running hundreds or thousands of jobs, automation is a necessity. 
This is where ``hopla`` can help you.

A simple example of how to use ``hopla`` on a SLURM cluster. Please check
the :ref:`user guide <user_guide>` for a more in depth presentation of all
functionalities.
